			Conner has been my fur baby of 12 years. I brought him into our
			family at 13 weeks old. He has been the light of my life and such a
			loyal companion. When researching what breed of dog to get, I made a
			list of qualities and traits I wanted in a companion. A Shih Tzu
			ended up being the perfect companion for me based on my search
			criteria.
